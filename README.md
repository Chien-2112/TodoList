## ⚡ Tech Stack
• **Axum** – is a powerful web framework built on top of Tokio and Tower, designed for building fast and modular web applications in Rust.
• **MongoDB** – is a NoSQL document-oriented database used for storing Todo items in JSON-like format.
Serde – is a Rust framework for serializing and deserializing data structures efficiently and safely.
• **JWT (JSON Web Token)** – is used for authentication and authorization, ensuring secure access to protected API routes.
• **dotenvy** – is a lightweight Rust library for managing environment variables securely. It loads configuration data (like database URLs and secret keys) from a .env file, helping keep sensitive information out of the source code.
• **Tokio** – is an asynchronous runtime for Rust that powers Axum.
